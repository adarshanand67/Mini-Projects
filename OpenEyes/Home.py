        - The idea behind this project is to create a chatbot that can answer questions related to animals.
        - The chatbot is trained on the [AnimalQA dataset](
        https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals
        ) from Kaggle.
        We thought that this app will help the tourists who are visiting safari parks and zoos and want to know more about the animals they see.
        They can scan the animals from their phones and our Object Detection model will detect the animal and then the chatbot will answer the questions related to the animal.
