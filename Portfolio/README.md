# Software Developer Folio ⚡️

<!-- ## A clean, beautiful and responsive portfolio template for Developers! -->

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73928744/202768779-a200a7ce-41e0-4f45-9b2d-cbd9296c7367.gif)

Just change `src/portfolio.js` to get your personal portfolio. Customize portfolio theme by using your own color scheme globally in the `src/_globalColor.scss` file. Feel free to use it as-is or personalize it as much as you want.

## Portfolio Sections

✔️ Summary and About me\
✔️ Skills\
✔️ Education\
✔️ Work Experience\
✔️ Open Source Projects Connected with GitHub\
✔️ Big Projects\
✔️ Achievements And Certifications 🏆\
✔️ Blogs\
✔️ Talks\
✔️ Podcast\
✔️ Contact me\
✔️ Twitter Timeline\
✔️ GitHub Profile

## Change and customize every section according to your need

<!-- #### Personalize page content in `/src/portfolio.js` & modify it as per your need. You will also need to modify `index.html` to change the title and metadata to provide accurate SEO for your personal portfolio -->

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your Personal Porfolio */

const greeting = { .... }

const socialMediaLinks = { .... }


const skillsSection = { .... }

const techStack = { .... }

const workExperience = { .... }

const openSource = { .... }

const bigProjects = { .... }

const achievementSection = { .... }

const blogSection = { .... }

const contactInfo = { .... }

const twitterDetails = { ... }

```

<!-- ### Customize Lottie Animations

You can choose a Lottie and download it in json format from from sites like [this](https://lottiefiles.com/). In `src/assets/lottie`, replace the Lottie json file you want to alter with the same file name. If you want to change the Lottie options, go to `src/components/displayLottie/DisplayLottie.js` and change the `defaultOptions` object, you can refer [react-lottie docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lottie) for more info on the `defaultOptions` object. -->
