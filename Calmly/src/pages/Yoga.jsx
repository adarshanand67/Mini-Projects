If it is more comfortable cross the legs in the opposite way. If it is difficult to keep the body upright then sit on a cushion at an appropriate height to make the posture comfortable. This sitting posture is recommended for those who have difficulty sitting for a long period of time in Siddhasana, Vajrasana or Padmasana."

The legs remain on the ground, unlike in the similar Upward Dog pose."
